# The database (Supabase Postgres)

ShopSense saves each shopper request, with its session ID, in a Supabase Postgres database (US-01, #14). The
database is **optional**: with no `DATABASE_URL` everything works and nothing is saved, and when the database is
down, slow or paused a search still finishes (build rule 10).

## What is stored, and why

One row per shopper request, in `public.requests`:

| Column | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `id` | A random UUID |
| `session_id` | The session the request belongs to, for example `sess_3f9a…` |
| `request_text` | The request exactly as typed (1 to 1000 characters) |
| `intent` | What we understood (category, use, budget, rules), only when it was clear enough to research |
| `intent_source` | How it was understood: `llm` or `rules` (the keyword rules, when no LLM answered) |
| `created_at` | When it was saved |

- **Why:** to see what people really ask for, to build evaluation sets from real requests, and later to remember
  returning shoppers (US-06).
- **Not stored:** no IP address, user agent, name, email or login.
- **Private:** requests are what people typed and may be personal. Never send stored requests to Gemini's free tier
  or any other model service that may train on its inputs. Never paste rows into chat, Slack or an issue.

Row level security is on with no policies, and the table is revoked from `anon` and `authenticated`. So Supabase's
Data API (the anon and logged-in browser keys) cannot read or write it. Only the backend's own database login can.

## Setting up the project (once, by hand, in the browser)

1. On supabase.com, create a project on the **Free** plan, region **South Asia (Mumbai)**.
   - Generate a strong database password and keep it in a password manager.
   - Invite Om (repo admin) and Jenish to the organisation.
2. Open **Project > Connect** and copy the **Session pooler** connection string.
   - Don't use the direct connection: on the Free plan it is IPv6 only and fails on most home and college networks.
     The session pooler works over IPv4.
3. Put it in the root `.env` (the same file as the LLM keys), with `?sslmode=require` at the end:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.<project-ref>:<password>@<session-pooler-host>:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
   ```
   - The host is the one shown under Session pooler in the dashboard.
   - Never paste the URL or the password into chat, Slack, an issue or a commit. `.env` is git-ignored.
   - Don't create `backend/.env`: the backend would find it first and stop reading the root `.env`.
4. Note the project's Postgres major version (**Settings > Infrastructure**). It is **17**; the tests use the same.
5. Apply the migrations (next section), then open **Advisors > Security**. It must show nothing for `public.requests`.

`DB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 2) is how long one save may take before the search carries on without it.

## Migrations

Every schema change is a new SQL file in `supabase/migrations/`, run in timestamp order. Never edit one that is
already merged; write a new one (see `supabase/migrations/README.md`). The Data & Evaluation Engineer reviews them.

Add one, from the repository root, with the pinned Supabase CLI:

```bash
npx supabase@2.120.0 migration new <short_name>
```

Apply them to the Supabase project. The commands read `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` without printing it.

Git Bash:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="$(python -c 'from dotenv import dotenv_values; print(dotenv_values(".env")["DATABASE_URL"])')"
npx supabase@2.120.0 db push --db-url "$DATABASE_URL"
unset DATABASE_URL
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = python -c "from dotenv import dotenv_values; print(dotenv_values('.env')['DATABASE_URL'])"
npx supabase@2.120.0 db push --db-url "$env:DATABASE_URL"
Remove-Item Env:DATABASE_URL
```

## "off" and "down"

`GET /api/health` answers `"database": "ok"`, `"off"` or `"down"`. Nothing else about the database is shown.

| | Meaning | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | The database answered | Requests are saved |
| `off` | No `DATABASE_URL` is set | Everything works; nothing is saved |
| `down` | It is set, but the database did not answer in time (wrong password, network, paused project) | Searches still finish; the request is not saved |

Each save waits at most `DB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. After 3 failures in a row the backend stops trying for 30 seconds
(saves fail at once, health says `down`), then tries once more. The session remembers the outcome in
`request_saved`: `saved`, `off` or `failed`. The CLI prints one line, and `--no-db` skips the database.

Logs show only the database host and the error type, never the URL, the password or the request text.

## The Free plan pauses idle projects

A Free project is paused after 7 days of low activity. A paused project shows as `down`, and nothing is saved.

- Resume it from the Supabase dashboard (the project page has a **Restore** button). It takes a few minutes.
- **Open the dashboard the day before every review**, so a pause never surprises a demo.

## Changing the password

1. In the dashboard: **Settings > Database > Reset database password**. Use a new strong password from the password
   manager.
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` in the root `.env` on every machine that has it, and in any CI secret that holds it.
3. Restart the backend. Until then it shows `down` (the old password no longer works).

## Tests

- **Unit and drill tests** need no database and run everywhere (`pytest`). The drills point the backend at a closed
  local port and at a server that never answers, and check that searches still finish and health says `down`.
- **Integration tests** (marker `db`) need a throwaway Postgres 17. They skip without `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. With
  `REQUIRE_DB_TESTS=1` a missing database fails them instead. They never run against Supabase: each run creates its
  own database, applies every migration, checks the table, row level security and the limits, and drops it.

```bash
docker run -d --name shopsense-pg17 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<local password> -p 127.0.0.1:55432:5432 postgres:17
cd backend
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:<local password>@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres pytest -m db -rs
docker rm -f shopsense-pg17
```
